## About This Page
I like taking notes, it helps me keep in several ways: It motivates me and avoids procrastination. I also like going back to my own notes, I realised reading my own notes is very helpful in refreshing my knowledge on a topic. It is also very nice to share knowledge and writing is like a theraphy. 

And last but not least, lets not forget..

> Idle hands are The Devil's playground.

## About Me
### Personal
I am a software developer working mainly with Java. I am married and  a father to cutest boys in the world.

I am by no means assertive in any way and usually very suspicious even to my own ideas. I am usually confused by how people can have very strong claims whether on programming or politics or whatever topic really.

### Interests
I like solving programming challenges but I am hardly good at them. I am always fascinated by the solutions people come up with when I compare it to my own solutions. There are some very talented people out there!

#### Wanted: Dev Buddy
I was unfortunately unable to find a dev-buddy, with whom I would like to attempt challenges we decide on and share and discuss our approaches later on. If you would be interested in something like this, reach by [email](koray@tugay.biz) please. Any level of expertise or any language is fine, actually solving challenges in a new language is a very good way to learn that language I think!
