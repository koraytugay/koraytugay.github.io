## About This Page
I like taking notes, it helps me keep in several ways:

- It motivates me
  - i.e. avoid procrastination
- I like going back to my notes
  - Reading my own notes is very helpful for me to refresh my knowledge on that topic
- I enjoy slowly building something
  - I am hoping it will be a long journey, and I enjoy the journey itself
- I am hoping to reach out to people
- Writing is very relaxing
  - It acts as a kind of therapy for me

And last but not least, lets not forget..

> Idle hands are The Devil's playground.

## About Me
### Personal
I am a `Year.now().compareTo(Year.of(1984))` years old Software Developer working mainly with Java. I am married and 
a father to cutest boys in the world.

I am by no means assertive in any way and usually very suspicious even to my own ideas. I am usually confused by 
how people can have very strong claims whether on programming or politics or whatever topic really.  

### Interests
I like solving programming challenges but I am hardly good at them. I am always fascinated by the solutions people come
up with when I compare it to my own solutions. There are some very talented people out there!

I am also highly interested in _what is really going on_ and have been seeking the answer for a while, however without
any success so far.

I used to play a lot of video games, but I am not very interested in them anymore. My all-time favorite is Fallout 2.

#### Wanted: Dev Buddy
I was unfortunately unable to find a dev-buddy, with whom I would like to attempt challenges we decide on and share
and discuss our approaches later on. If you would be interested in something like this, reach me at 
[koray@tugay.biz](koray@tugay.biz) please. Any level of expertise or any language is fine, actually solving challenges in a 
new language is a very good way to learn that language I think!  

### Education and Work Experience
I studied Civil Engineering and did an MSc on Structural Engineering. However I always wanted to work with computers 
and I was always interested in programming, so after working in the Civil Engineering industry for a short while,
I managed to land a remote job in [Innflow](https://www.innflow.com), a company in Switzerland, where I started working 
with the title `Software Test Engineer`. I started by doing manual tests since I did not know anything else to do. 
(If you are interested in moving into IT from a different field, just reach out to me for my experience.) In the 
mean time I also did MSc on Software Engineering to get a formal education. 

I worked remotely for Innflow from Turkey for around 6 years. The first 2 years were mostly testing, but then they moved
me to development, and the last 4 year was mostly if not all development. The culture and the people were very nice
in Innflow, and I think it was one of the best things happened to me in my life.

We then moved to Canada with my family (where we are currently living) and I started working at 
[GS1 Canada](https://www.gs1ca.org) as a `Java Developer`. The job hunting in Canada was very though for me. I messed up
so bad in several interviews. After working for exactly a year, I am now working at [Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/), 
again as a `Software Developer` working with Java.

I am hoping to keep working in Information Technologies as a developer until I retire, where in the mean time I 
can keep learning new things, share my knowledge and build, maintain and fix software.
