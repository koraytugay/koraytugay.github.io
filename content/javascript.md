## Overview
This page is a draft and is a work in progress...

## Data Types
### Strings
A String must be surrounded by quotes. There are 3 types of quotes:

1. Double quotes: `"Hello World!"`
1. Single quotes: `'Hello World!'`
1. Backtics: `\`Hello World!\``

Backtics come with the following over single and double quotes. 

```javascript
const newLineSupport = 
  `Backticks support new lines.
  Like this..`;

const myName = 'Koray';
const variableSupport = `Hello ${myName}`!`;
```
