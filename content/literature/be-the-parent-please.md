# Be the Parent Please
## Happy Children
- In order to be happy, a child needs
  - to eat well
  - to sleep well
  - exercise
  - have friends
  - intellectual stimulation

## Technology as the X Factor
- Greatest Feature of the Technological Age: The ability to distract ourselves from boredom and discomfort
- How technology affects our children.. Little changes in
  - their attitudes
  - sleeping habits
  - their ability to focus

_Question:_ Do they need technology or do they just want it?

> We might have thought that these bells and whistles would enhance the educational value of the toy. Our results, however, suggest otherwise.
>
> .. when parents read e-books rather than traditional books to their three-year-olds, their children are less likely to follow the plotline of the story.

- Just because a children really seems to follow a show does not mean the child is learning from it
  - They just want to press the colorful buttons over and over. They get the "I did it" feeling
- Digital note taking is not as efficient as the traditional note taking.

> Writing by hand is slower and more cumbersome than typing and students can not possibly write everything they hear.
> Instead, they listen, digest and summarise the content. Thus, taking notes by hand forces the brain to engage in mental lifting.
> By contracts, when typing, students simply transcribe everything without any mental effort done on the content. 

- Consuming digital content, even if it is just text, is not as effective as reading from a physical book or paper 
  - The increased demand of decision-making, the surrounding noise and the options, and visual processing impairs reading performance
