# One on One Meetings

## The Ultimate Goal
What is your ultimate goal sparing half an hour to an employee every week, having a one on one meeting? When you ask _why_ a few times, where do you end up as a manager (or as the company)?

## How to make the best out of a One on One Meeting?
One on one meetings can be very motivating and useful for seeing for the manager to see if the employee actually is happy. It is of course also a very good opportunity to ask all sorts of questions, such as:

- What can we improve?
- What can we do better?
- How can I support you?

Even just having a casual conversation can be a source of self-esteem or make the employee they are valued and listened to.  

## Can a One on One Meeting Backfire?
I believe so. Asking questions based on assumptions may put unnecessary pressure on the employee, or may let them think their engineer think they are falling behind or unhappy with their performance. (Of course, if that is the case, the best thing would be to share the situation openly.) 

As an example consider the following question: _"What do you think of doing Individual Objectives and Key Results for this quarter?"_. 

The employee may wonder what makes the engineer think they have _OKR_ s. I am already working for your company full time, __must I__ have __Individual Objectives__? Must they be work related? Why does my manager think I even have Individual Objectives, am I falling behind and are they hinting me with the question?

The solution I believe is asking questions in a supportive manner..

- Are there any new technologies or subjects you want to learn or experiment with?
- Do you have a schedule for it, a deadline to keep you motivated?
- Is there anything I can help with? Funding? 

Another good practice would be to suggest something to the employee in the first place. A manager, ideally, should have a better vision of the company, where the company is headed. Instead of just asking what the Employee is up to, making a suggestion to the employee, something like starting with.. "So we are planning on supporting Mongo DB" or "There are plans ahead to make use of Kubernetes.." and finishing with "..would you be interested in taking part when it is time? We will need people familiar with this technology" would give the hint and the motivation to the employee..
