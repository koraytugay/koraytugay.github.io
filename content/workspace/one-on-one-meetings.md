## The Ultimate Goal
What is your ultimate goal sparing half an hour to an employee every week, having a one on one meeting? When you ask _why_ a few times, where do you end up as their manager (or as the company)?

## How to make the best out of a One on One Meeting?
One on one meetings can be very motivating for the employee. Even just having a casual conversation can be a source of self-esteem or make the employee feel they are valued and are being listened to.

It is of course also a good opportunity to see the work enviornment from the employees point of view:

- What can we improve?
- What can we do better?
- What is not working for you?

## Can a One on One Meeting Backfire?
I believe so. 

### Too Much Pressure
Asking questions based on assumptions may put pressure on the employee, or may let them think they are falling behind or their manager is unhappy with their performance. (Of course, if that is the case, the best thing would be to share the situation openly.) 

As an example consider the following question: _"What do you think of doing Individual Objectives and Key Results for this quarter?"_. 

The employee may wonder what makes the engineer think they have _OKR_ s. 

- Must I have __Individual Objectives__? 
- Must they be work related? 
- Why does my manager think I even have Individual Objectives, am I falling behind and are they hinting me with the question?
- Even if I do have Individual Objectives, must they be for a given quarter?

The solution I believe is asking questions in a supportive manner..

- Are there any new technologies or subjects you want to learn or currently experimenting with?
- Do you have a schedule, a deadline to keep you motivated?
  - Are you planning on building a toy project?
  - Are you planning on building some documentation on it?
  - Are you planning on taking a certification exam?
- Would you like to make a "tech talk", a presentation about it?
- Is there anything we can help with? 
  - Would you need funding?
  - Would you want me to see if anyone else is interested in this so you can pair with them?
- Is it something related to what we do here? Would you share how we can incorporate it to our product(s)?
  - The key here is again the first question: Do not assume the subject in question is something that can directly be applied to the company or the products. It is employees own time after all.

#### Vision and Suggestions
Another good practice would be to make a direct suggestion to the employee.

A manager should have a better vision of the company, where the company is headed. Instead of just asking what the employee is up to, making a suggestion to the employee, something in the lines of _"So we are planning on supporting Mongo Database"_ or _"There are plans ahead to make use of Kubernetes.."_, _"..would you be interested in taking part when it is time? We will need people familiar with this technology."_ would give the hint and the motivation to the employee.
